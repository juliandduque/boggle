# Boggle
Java Boggle V3.0


This project was made for the class Object Oriented Programming for the University of Central Florida. 

This is a program implementation version of the real boggle game written in Java.


Known bugs:
- There are repeated words in the dictionary.
- Some words are missing.

Fixed bugs:
- Infinite loop fixed by exiting program once clock reaches 0. 
- Time does not start at 3:02.
- Program exits once the counter reaches 0:00.

Want to contribute?

Feel free to use this code! The most problematic piece is the GUI, it would be nice to merge it from Java.x.swing to something like GWIT so it can be implemented online.
